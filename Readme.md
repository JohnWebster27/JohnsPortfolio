# Welcome to my data analysis portfolio!

I plan to be adding files to this folder monthly at the very least. My goal is to become a data scientist within the healthcare field. I am currently working on a MS in Data Science that I anticipate finishing
in the spring of 2026. I currently have a MPH in epidemiology and am a practicing infectious disease epidemiologist. The languages I currently use in my work related activities are:

- Python
- R
- SAS 9.4

I am constantly working to add new skills to my toolbet. Future plans include learning to use PowerBI, continue my previous learning of ArcGIS, and mastering SQL.
