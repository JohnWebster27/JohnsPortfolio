# Welcome to my data science portfolio!

I plan to be adding files to this folder that demonstrate my knowledge of deploying machine learning models and I always welcome suggestions on where I can improve. My goal is to become a leading data scientist in the industry. I am currently working on a MS in Data Science that I anticipate finishing
in the fall of 2025. Please feel free to look through my projects in either Python or R and know that I will be adding new projects as time allows. Thank you for taking the time to look at my work!
